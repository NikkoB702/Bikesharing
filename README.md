## Overview

Our database consists of Citi Bike data curated in New York from August 2019. We chose the month of August because there is likely to be more traffic during the summer months. In total we tracked and drilled down data for over two million rides.

## Results

##### Customers
* Our first pie chart breaks down the customer to subscriber ratio. Subscribers outweigh customers by a five to one clip. Studies suggest that we should focus on creating new subscribers as a key business model practice.

##### Checkout Times for Users
* Our first line chart shows minutes of trip duration in relation to volume of bikes used. Studies show that customers are likely to use our product for less than an hour per ride.

##### Gender Breakdown
* In this pie chart we break down the customer base by gender. We can see from the results that males are more likely to use our product. This starts to form our key demographic. 

##### Checkout Times by Gender
* This line chart defines the trip duration in relation to volume chart from earlier by introducing gender splits. Not much is derived from these results. 

##### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
* Our first heat chart outlines the heaviest volume of use by hour. We can notice right away that the heaviest volume correlates to rush hour periods during the work week.

##### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
* Our second heat chart introduces gender splits in our previous heat chart. Little variance is noticed; however, our key demographic is starting to become more defined.

##### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
* In our final heat chart, we introduce the customer to subscriber splits to our previous heat chart. Our key demographic becomes well established at this point. 

##### Top Starting/Ending Locations
* Our map charts highlight a correlation between urban settings and heavier volume of usage. Using starting point and ending point data we can see that hubs and bike repairs should be consistent with these findings. 

## Summary

Based on our findings we can accurately describe our customers and build a business model that uses our data as a focal point. Who is our customer? What do they look like? Well studies suggest that males tend to use our product more than females. We also learn that our customers tend to use our product with the intention of commuting to and from work and we can correlate that data with our findings on condensed portions of the city seeing the highest volume of rides. 

With all this in mind I’d suggest a marketing campaign that’s tailored to our findings as well as strategic locations for bike hubs and repair facilities. Regarding our findings related to gender specific categories, I’d suggest to our marketing staff to avoid focusing on the male aspect of the equation and find creative ways to balance the scale. In my opinion if we can strike an equal balance of customers by gender, our company will have a higher probability of success. 

One conclusion that correlates our data with business-driven decisions is our customer to subscriber ratio. We cannot ignore the fact that we have a much higher subscriber count than customer count. This suggests that we should focus extensively on how to create new subscriptions and make subscriptions a core value to our business model. Incentives for subscriptions are paramount to our success.
