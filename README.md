## Overview

Our database consists of Citi Bike data curated in New York from August 2019. We chose the month of August because there is likely to be more traffic during the summer months. In total we tracked and drilled down data for over two million rides.

## Results

* Our first pie chart breaks down the customer to subscriber ratio. Subscribers outweigh customers by a five to one clip. Studies suggest that we should focus on creating new subscribers as a key business model practice.
