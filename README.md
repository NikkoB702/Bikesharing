## Overview

Our database consists of Citi Bike data curated in New York from August 2019. We chose the month of August because there is likely to be more traffic during the summer months. In total we tracked and drilled down data for over two million rides.

## Results

##### Customers
* Our first pie chart breaks down the customer to subscriber ratio. Subscribers outweigh customers by a five to one clip. Studies suggest that we should focus on creating new subscribers as a key business model practice.

##### Checkout Times for Users
* Our first line chart shows minutes of trip duration in relation to volume of bikes used. Studies show that customers are likely to use our product for less than an hour per ride.

##### Gender Breakdown
* In this pie chart we break down the customer base by gender. We can see from the results that males are more likely to use our product. This starts to form our key demographic. 

##### Checkout Times by Gender
* This line chart defines the trip duration in relation to volume chart from earlier by introducing gender splits. Not much is derived from these results. 

##### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
* Our first heat chart outlines the heaviest volume of use by hour. We can notice right away that the heaviest volume correlates to rush hour periods during the work week.

##### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
* Our second heat chart introduces gender splits in our previous heat chart. Little variance is noticed; however, our key demographic is starting to become more defined.

##### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
* In our final heat chart, we introduce the customer to subscriber splits to our previous heat chart. Our key demographic becomes well established at this point. 

##### Top Starting/Ending Locations
* Our map charts highlight a correlation between urban settings and heavier volume of usage. Using starting point and ending point data we can see that hubs and bike repairs should be consistent with these findings.
